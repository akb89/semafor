# Prepare scripts
Process a standard set of FrameNet data and generate all files required by
Semafor

## cv.***.sentences files
Divide between training and testing. Process fulltext and exemplars separately. 
Careful, certain sentences are identical although they may have different IDs and may be found under different documents

We add two important verifications:
- The sentence contains FrameNet annotation (see previous NAACL dataset)
- The sentence is not found in the test set (when processing the training set)

## cv.***.sentences.tokenized
This is processed with a separate tokenizer

## cv.***.frame.elements
The structure a line of the file is as follow:
FE_VALUE_0	FE_VALUE_1	#(frame + FEs)	Frame	LU	#target	target	#sentence	FE	feStart:feEnd

A **very important point** to note is that indexes (for FE spans and targets) are based on the tokenized splits, NOT on the sentence splits. Ex.:
```
Insert example here
```
There are in total *** sentences than cannot be parsed due to failed mapping. 

 Important points:
 - We create a map to map index in sentences from index in tokenized sentences
 - Targets can have spans larger than a single token. When this occurs indexes are separated by a `_` like `12_14` in sentence: _______________________
 - FEs can have spans larger than a single token. When this occurs indexes are separated by a `:` like `12:14`in sentence

 There have also been rumors of using mines to deliver CW agents ( 120 mm ) .

 marked in NAACL splits as:
 ```
 2	Existence	there be.v	0_1_2_3	There have also been	1030	Entity	4:14
 ```
 while FrameNet annotation actually is:
 ```
 <annotationSet cDate="03/09/2005 11:37:43 PST Wed" luID="10329" luName="there be.v" frameID="660" frameName="Existence" status="MANUAL" ID="1992359">
             <layer rank="1" name="Target">
                 <label cBy="395" end="4" start="0" name="Target"/>
                 <label cBy="395" end="19" start="16" name="Target"/>
             </layer>
             <layer rank="1" name="FE">
                 <label cBy="395" feID="4381" bgColor="0000FF" fgColor="FFFFFF" end="73" start="21" name="Entity"/>
             </layer>
             <layer rank="1" name="GF">
                 <label end="73" start="21" name="Ext"/>
             </layer>
             <layer rank="1" name="PT">
                 <label end="73" start="21" name="NP"/>
             </layer>
             <layer rank="1" name="Other"/>
             <layer rank="1" name="Sent"/>
             <layer rank="1" name="Verb"/>
         </annotationSet>

 ```
 
 ### Targets
 targets need be extracted "as is" and be continuous. 
 Ex: there be.v in `There have also been`. Target is `there have also been` although it is annotated in FrameNet as `there been`

## .xml files
1. frames.xml
2. frRelations.xml
3. framenet.frame.element.map
4. reqData.jobj
5. sparsegraph.gz

## Training and testing
1. Divide cv.train and cv.test (for FrameNet 1.5 config with default fulltext)
2. .tokenized
3. .mstparsed.conll
4. .frame.elements
5. .all.lemma.tags
